# Applicant-Tracking-System

This project involves building a Flask web application for the Resume screening script that can be deployed/hosted on AWS cloud. 

Data files are Job_Data.csv and Resume_Data.csv.

Run resume_screener.py to launch the Flask application. 
On the web app, you feed in the name of the job position and the model will return the top 5 resumes suitable for that position from the database.
